= 2.1 Deploying as Source To Image Application

include::_attributes.adoc[]

Now that the application code is working, we're ready to build it as a container image, create an OpenShift deployment, and have it running as a service you will be able to call from any other application.

This repository was created as a source to image Python application.  A Python application developer and a data scientist can work together in this repository to create the buildable application.  You can see the template https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-s2i-project-simple[GitHub repository] and try for yourself.

Some interesting files to examine in the application::

* https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/object-detection-rest/blob/master/wsgi.py[wsgi.py] - the main entrypoint for the python application and calls the prediction function.
* https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/object-detection-rest/blob/master/prediction.py[prediction.py] -which contains the function the data scientist has extracted to make predictions.  Called from the application with a dictionary parameter.
* https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/object-detection-rest/blob/master/requirements.txt[requirements.txt] - where both the app developer and data scientists add their python dependencies for the served application.
* https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/object-detection-rest/tree/master/.s2i[s2i directory] - which contains files to customize the application deployment

Now, let's create the application.

== OpenShift Console

We'll start from the *OpenShift Console*.

If you're at the OpenShift Data Science Dashboard and need to navigate to the OpenShift Web Console, use the *Application Switcher* Icon in the top right of the navigation bar and click on the *OpenShift Console* menu item.

* From the OpenShift Console and switch to the developer view from the menu on the top left if it's not already selected:

* Make sure you have selected (or created) the correct project for your application:

== Add an Application from Git

* From the `+Add` menu, click on the `From Git` tile:

== Configure the Application

=== Set the Git Repo

* In the ``Git Repo URL`` field, enter: `+https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/object-detection-rest.git+`

* Leave the other builder image selection to the default. You will see that OpenShift automatically recognized that our repo contains Python code, and that the right base image has been selected. Pretty neat, eh?!

=== Customize the App Names

* Let's customize the name of our application.  Instead of `object-detection-rest-git-app` and `object-detection-rest-git`, let's change the *Application name* to `object-detection` and the *Name* to  `object-detection-rest`.  Later when we call our service internally from the same project, we'll use this name and the service port, `http://object-detection-rest:8080`.

=== Create

* If you continue to scroll down, you will see that everything is automatically selected to create a deployment of your application, and to create a Route through which you will be able to access it. Everything is ready, so you can click on *Create*:

== Checking your Application

* You will see that a build is going on:

image::s2i/topology.png[alt text, 800]

* Click on the python logo in the center of the deployment to open a detail panel on the right.

* The automated building process will take a few minutes. Some alerts (such as ImgPullBackOff) may appear while the first build is still running, but that's OK. Then OpenShift will deploy the application (rollout).  When it's complete you can see the build is complete and the pod is running.
