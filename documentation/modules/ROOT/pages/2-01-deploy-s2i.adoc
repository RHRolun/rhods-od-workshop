= 2.1 Deploying as Source To Image Application

include::_attributes.adoc[]

Now that the application code is working, we're ready to build it as a container image, create an OpenShift deployment, and have it running as a service you will be able to call from any other application.

== Add an Application from Git
* Open your OpenShift UI and switch to the developer view from the menu on the top left:

* Make sure you have selected the correct project for your application:

* From the `+Add` menu, click on the `From Git` tile:

== Configure the Application

=== Set the Git Repo

* In the ``Git Repo URL`` field, enter: `+https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/object-detection-rest.git+`

* Leave the other builder image selection to the default. You will see that OpenShift automatically recognized that our repo contains Python code, and that the right base image has been selected. Pretty neat, eh?!

=== Customize the App Names

* Let's customize the name of our application.  Instead of `object-detection-rest-git-app` and `object-detection-rest-git`, let's change the *Application name* to `object-detection` and the *Name* to  `object-detection-rest`.  Later when we call our service internally from the same project, we'll use this name and the service port, `http://object-detection-rest:8080`.

=== Create

* If you continue to scroll down, you will see that everything is automatically selected to create a deployment of your application, and to create a Route through which you will be able to access it. Everything is ready, so you can click on `Create`:

== Checking your Application

* You will see that a build is going on:

* Click on the deployment to open a detail panel on the right.

* The automated building process will take a few minutes. Some alerts (such as ImgPullBackOff) may appear while the first build is still running, but that's OK. Then OpenShift will deploy the application (rollout).  When it's complete you can see the build is complete and the pod is running.
