= 3.2 Restart a Notebook Server

include::_attributes.adoc[]

== Introduction

Now that we have a working Kafka Instance we can connect to, we can try out sending and receiving messages from a Jupyter notebook.  We'll start a notebook and connect to your new Kafka instance.  Then, we'll show a different kind of application using the exact same prediction code to consume and produce streaming data.

For now, return to Red Hat OpenShift Data Science and navigate to JupyterHub.

== Stopping a Notebook

If you're notebook is currently running, you might want to restart with a new base image or different settings.  In this case, we need to restart our notebook with our Kafka connection information from the Hub Control Panel (Start a notebook server page).

* Navigate through the menu to *File* -> *Hub Control Panel*

* Wait for the Stop My Server button to disappear and then click the *Start My Server* Button

== Starting a Notebook to Connect to Kafka

This should bring you back to the now familar "Start a notebook server" page.  We're going to start a notebook with the environment variables necessary to connect to Kafka.  Then we can make sure everything is working before we deploy our AI Application.

On the "Start a notebook server" page, enter in the fields.

* Set *Notebook image* to *TensorFlow*.

* Set *Container size* to *Small*

* Add *Environment variables* +
To add environment variables click *Add more variables* for each variable and enter the variable info.  Afterwards, to hide the value and save it in a Kubernetes secret, click the secret checkbox.  +
Now, add the following three variables with the information you recorded during your Kafka instance creation:

** `Custom Variable`
*** Variable name: `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER`
*** Variable value: `<Kafka Bootstrap server>`
** `Custom Variable`
*** Variable name: `KAFKA_USERNAME`
** Variable value: `<Service Account Client ID>`
** `Custom Variable`
*** Variable name: `KAFKA_PASSWORD`
*** Variable value: `<Service Account Client secret>`

* Click *Start server*

This will start your notebook server. Now you're ready to xref:3-03-explore-kafka.adoc[head to the next section.]
