= 2.2 Testing the Deployed API

include::_attributes.adoc[]

== App Status

You now have an application listening at the route that was created during the deployment.

If you scroll down on the detail panel, you will see the route that was created for your application. This is the URL you will use to send images:

image::s2i/topology-route.png[alt text, 640]

You can test it but simply clicking on the route link, or copy/paste it in your browser:

image::s2i/app-status.png[alt text, 800]

== Uploading images

As our application is now a REST API endpoint, there are multiple ways to upload images to it. Here are a few.

NOTE:  as our prediction function is waiting for a json payload with a base64 encoded image, we must do this encoding first.

=== CURL on Linux or Mac with bash/zsh

From anywhere you have an example image like `twodogs.jpg` (replace with the right name in the command, as well as the Route with `/predictions` at the end):

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
(echo -n '{"image": "'; base64 twodogs.jpg; echo '"}') | curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- http://object-detection-rest-user-dev.apps.demo.gmkc.p1.openshiftapps.com/predictions
----

=== Invoke-WebRequest on Windows with Powershell

From anywhere you have an example image like `twodogs.jpg` (replace with the complete path and name in the command, as well as the Route with `/predictions` at the end):

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,powershell]
----
Write-Output ('{"image": "' + ([Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('C:\Users\Guillaume\Downloads\twodogs.jpg'))) + '"}') | iwr -Uri http://licence-plate-workshop-git-lpr-workshop.apps.rhods-test.rqdu.p1.openshiftapps.com/predictions -Method 'POST' -ContentType: 'application/json' | Select-Object -Expand Content
----

=== From a notebook

* Open the notebook named `04_test_flask.ipynb`
* Upload an image in your environment
* In the first cell, replace the placeholders with your:
 ** Image path and name.
 ** Route to the service.
* Run the cells and see the result!
