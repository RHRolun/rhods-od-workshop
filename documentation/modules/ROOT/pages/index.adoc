== Introduction

Welcome!

In this workshop, you'll learn how AI/ML enables us to identify objects in images. 

You will: 

* use Jupyter Notebooks TensorFlow to explore a pre-trained object detection model
* use source-to-image (s2i) to serve the model as a Flask App
* explore Kafka streams from notebooks
* deploy a Kafka consumer with the same object detection model

And all of this without having to install anything on your own computer, thanks to *Red Hat OpenShift Data Science* and *Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka*.
