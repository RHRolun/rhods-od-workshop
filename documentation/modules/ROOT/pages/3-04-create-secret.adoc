= 3.4 Create a Secret for Kafka Credentials

include::_attributes.adoc[]

Earlier, we created a Kafka instance and recorded the connection information.  Now, we need to use this information in multiple places, both our front-end application and our new Kafka consumer.  Instead of setting this on each deployment, we'll create a secret and add it to our applications.  For this we'll need our connection information for Kafka, including:

* Kafka Bootstrap server
* Service Account Client ID
* Service Account Client secret

== Create the Secret from YAML

* First, make sure you have selected the correct project for your application.

* Now navigate to *Secrets*

* Click *Create* and choose *From YAML*

* Paste the following YAML into your secret

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: object-detection-kafka
  labels:
    app: object-detection
    app.kubernetes.io/component: object-detection
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: object-detection
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: object-detection
data:
stringData:
  KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER: <Enter your Kafka Bootstrap server>
  KAFKA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL: SASL_SSL
  KAFKA_SASL_MECHANISM: PLAIN
  KAFKA_USERNAME: <Enter your Kafka SA Client ID>
  KAFKA_PASSWORD: <Enter your Kafka SA Client Secret>
  KAFKA_TOPIC_IMAGES: images
  KAFKA_TOPIC_OBJECTS: objects
----

* Modify the values for `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER`, `KAFKA_USERNAME`, `KAFKA_PASSWORD` to match your recorded information.
** `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER` location of the Kafka bootstrap Server.  e.g. 'abc.xyz.kafka.rhcloud.com:443'
** `KAFKA_USERNAME`  Client ID of the Service Account you created e.g. 'srvc-acct-1234-5678-abcd-efgj-12345678abcd'
** `KAFKA_PASSWORD` Client secret of the Service Account you created. e.g. 'abcd1234-5678-abcd-efgj-12345678abcd'

NOTE: `KAFKA_TOPIC_IMAGES: images` and `KAFKA_TOPIC_OBJECTS: objects` assumes you named the topics as suggested.  You also could modify the values to connect to Kafka instances with different settings as documented in the https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaClient.html[kafka-python docs].

* Click *Create* to save your new secret.

== Add the Secret to the Front-End Application

Now let's add this information as environment variables to our deployed application.

* Click *Add Secret to workload*

image::kafka/secret-created.png[alt text, 800]

* Select *object-detection-app* deployment as the workload.

* Click *Save*

image::kafka/secret-add-workload.png[alt text, 800]

You'll be redirected to you application.  It will redeploy a new pod to pick up the changes.

* Navigate to the *Environment* tab.  There you can see the values have been added to your deployment.

Now that the fronte-end application can connect to Kafka, let's create and connect a consumer in xref:3-05-kakfa-consumer.adoc[the next section.]
